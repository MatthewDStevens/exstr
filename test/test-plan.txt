This project requires extensive testing.
All cases must be covered for current and future use.

Areas to test include:
    -Normal Cases
    -Reentrancy
    -Thread Safety
    -Efficiency

Normal cases are self-explanitory.
Reentrancy and thread safety must be properly documented.
Efficiency will be measured relative to other dynamic string libraries and the standard C library static string manipulation functions.
