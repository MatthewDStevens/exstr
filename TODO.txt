Should we rely on size_t?
Create type generic macro versions of functions.
Black box common functionality, try not to sacrifice performance.
Include basic thread safety, rely on pthread for now.
Make thread safety operating system independent.
Include wide string and/or UTF-8/16/32 support.
Use stdbool.h, it's not that bad.
