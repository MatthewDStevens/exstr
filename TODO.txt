Create type generic macro versions of functions.
Black box common functionality, try not to sacrifice performance.
Include basic thread safety, rely on pthread for now.
Make thread safety operating system independent.
Include wide string and/or UTF-8/16/32 support.
Allow sparse string insertion. (maybe, I don't like it, but users might)
Use autotools
Add "n" versions of functions
